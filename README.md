## 2. Stack
To create the website I used many things I've learned in my frontend development path.  

#### I used:  
ðŸš€ Parcel (I added a little of configuration).    
ðŸš€ SASS (nesting, variables, imports, mixins).   
ðŸš€ BEM.    
ðŸš€ 7-1 CSS.  
ðŸš€ OOCSS.  
ðŸš€ CSS (Flexbox, CSS Grid, Animations, Mediaqueries).  
ðŸš€ Glide.js.  
ðŸš€ Adobe Illustrator (I created SVG images).   
ðŸš€ Java Script (ES6)

## 3. About components of website
I built some nice components.
### 3.1 Mobile menu
I was inspired by a menu which I had found in one website on the internet. I debugged that menu, copied some elements and added others.

### 3.2 Carousel
I used Glide.js. I've customized settings and overridden styles to achieve effects that I wanted. I installed a few instances with different options.

### 3.3 Card
Cards have the same height and buttons are on the bottom. While hovering cursor pointer on the card it enlarges and changes shadow. Also image in the card is transformed.

### 3.4 Button
I customized the button which I had found in a collection of buttons on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/markmead/pen/mjpGvj).

### 3.5 Popup
I customized the popup which I'd learned in the course  ["Advanced CSS and Sass"](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/).

### 3.6 Heart animation
I built an animated heart component to separate sections on the page.

## 4. Optimalizations
Before publishing the page on the internet, I'd been focusing on page optimalization.   

I did a test on [web.dev](https://web.dev/) and after that I did some improvements. Finally I've achieved 4 x 100/100.

To optimize the site I used stuff like: padding hack, font-face property, picture attribute, webP format, etc.

### 4.1 Padding hack
I used this to prevent the page content from moving. I've learnt it from [Alex Carpenter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSaBRUgAXnk&list=PL_Isa-qWGFalHTEdh06r4uQVnSPIlf55s&index=8). 

### 4.2 I've used font-face instead @import fonts from google
I've learnt it from this [article](https://www.machmetrics.com/speed-blog/google-fonts-slow-your-site-make-google-fonts-faster/).

### 4.3 I've used picture atribute and modern webfonts
I've learnt It from the course [The Ultimate HTML/CSS Mastery Series](https://codewithmosh.com/p/the-ultimate-html-css).   

I used this site to crop images [onlineconvertfree.com](https://onlineconvertfree.com/pl/crop-image/).   

I used this site to resize images [www.iloveimg.com](https://www.iloveimg.com/resize-image).   

I used this site to convert images to webP [cloudconvert.com/](https://cloudconvert.com/).   

### 4.4 lazy loading
Images are loaded only when it is necessary.

## 5. Development
This is my first website I've published on the Internet. I'm glad from this site, but I have some ideas to do.  

In the future I'm going to work on some stuff like:
- FAQ subpage
- Person Introduction
- Articles subpage
- Focusing on SEO
